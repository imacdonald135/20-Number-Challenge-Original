# 20-Number-Challenge-Original
These are the original python scripts I wrote for the 20 Number Challenge. Not the cleanest or greatest code but I wrote this quickly to get the idea down and basic functionality works.

The game is very hard to beat, with around a 1/10000 chance of beating it using the stratergy the bot uses.

## Player Version

This one is to be run and played through the terminal, pretty straight forward.

## Automated Version

This one a bot plays a lot of games and reports how many it won. The strategy it uses it to try put numbers 1-49 in slot one, 50-99 in slot to and so forth. If it can't it puts the number in the closest free elegant slot.
